# This is my Final Assignment for the course Coding for Economists

In the pythoncode folder there are 3 python files including the relevant code for python.
In the statacode folder, I am analysing a dataset from my work, and there are dofiles, the resulting cleaned dataset and resulting graphs. 

## My  aim is to fulfil the following points

1. Understand folder structure. Perform operations on files in different folders.
2. Automate repeating tasks using Python “for” loops.
3. Use Python “lists” and “dictionaries” appropriately. Demonstrate one of the two.
4. Break up work into smaller components using Stata .do files.
5. Read .csv data in in Stata.
6. Fix common data quality errors in Stata (for example, string vs number, missing value).
7. Prepare a sample for analysis by filtering observations and variables and creating transformations of variables. Demonstrate all three.
8. Save data in Stata.
9. Run ordinary least squares regression in Stata.
10. Create a graph (of any type) in State.
11. Save graphs as files.
12. Commit files into git version control.
13. Name files, functions and variables appropriately.
14. Write helpful comments and commit messages. Demonstrate both.
15. Push a repository to GitHub.
16. Explain how to reproduce your work with short instructions or a self-documenting master script.
