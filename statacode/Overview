This is a dataset that I work on for my job. I'm doing similar things for this exercise as what I do for my work assignments. 

1. imported a csv file
2. cleaning data
    - dropping unnecessary variables
    - through the importation some observation rows were added, so I'm removing those as well
    - destringing numeric variables
    - changing the variable names witha  loop func (removing_1)
3. saving dta as clean.dta

Thenn, in the regression dofile 
1. generate treatment binary (for regression)
2. generating new cumulative variables
3. regressing the cumulative variables on the treatment
4. plotting the resulting coefficients in a graph
